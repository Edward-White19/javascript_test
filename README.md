# Title: javascript_test
This program houses various JavaScript tests by an amateur developer.

## Header: Conditional Statements
More precisely, this program contains demonstrations of conditional statements written in JavaScript.

### Subheader: Loops
A primary test situation is loops.

| Statement                               | Function |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| <code>while (\<cond>) {...}             | Loops for as long as the condition is true. |
| <code>do {...} while (\<cond>)          | Same as the above, but the condition is checked at the end of the code block. |
| <code>for (\<var>;\<cond>;\<inc>)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{...} | Increments a counter variable at the end of each loop, exiting when the counter reaches its target. |
